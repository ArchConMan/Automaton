=============

New features/fixes:
- Machine::trigger() method
- Tiny machines
- Att_* tiny machines for all bundled machines except Atm_teensywave
- Atm_timer: added interval_seconds(), now supports timers up to 137 years
- Atm_command fixes: either \r or \n works for EOL, matches whole commands only
- Atm_led: blink cycle now includes the trailing pause
- Added sleep() method to sleep/wake up machines and request sleep status
- Atm_led: repeat(0) makes led not blink
- Atm_led: added onFinish() method 
- Automatic cycle() added on a trigger() call
- Machines now have the sleep bit set on declaration which is cleared on begin() call (avoid cycling uninitialized machines)
- Factory::cycle now takes a time argument (ms) after which it will stop running (0 default: after 1 cycle)
- Machine::cycle now takes a time argument (ms) after which it will stop running (0 default: after 1 cycle)
- Added Factory::msgWrite() with class and wildcard support (replaces msgSend*)

- Atm_led/fade: added EVT_TOGGLE & EVT_TOGGLE_BLINK events

Breaking changes:
- trigger machine variable changed to last_trigger
- dropped toggle, runtime_*, msgMap, runtime_millis(), runtime_micros()
- ON_ENTER action is now fired after each state( new_state ) call
- Atm_timer added extra 'int cnt' argument to callback
- atm_timer_micros() & atm_timer_millis(): dropped begin() added 'this' argument to expired()
- TinyMachine no longer supports microsecond timers
- Dropped all msg* methods, replaced completely by trigger()
- Dropped BaseMachine::asleep(), replaced by sleep()
- Changed machine.onSwitch( atm_serial_debug::onSwitch ) to machine.trace( &Serial )
- Changed trace method format
- Dropped Atm_teensywav + example, depends on Teensy 3.x
- Most methods now take references to machines instead of pointers: leave the & off
